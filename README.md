## [My Procees](#myprocess)
- [Build With](#buildwith)

    -  HTML5(Adding Semantic HTML elements  and repalce non semantic elemnents)
    -  CSS3 (Modify stylesheet according to the HTML elements)

- [What I Learned](#whatleaned)

    - It is best to build HTML with semantic elements to increase readability and provide a good reading experience.
    - Image elements need to have accessible alt attributes, and image elements do not need a closing tag.
    - Add the id attribute to the heading that needs to be navigated.Id is more specific then class
    - A unique title is required.
    - The heading attributes fall in sequential order.
    - Use class to reduce or merge duplicates in css.
